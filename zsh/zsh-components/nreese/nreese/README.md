nreese - an opinionated jreese
===

* Why?

	- jreese is one of my favourite ZSH themes, but I dont like some of the quirks about it, so I decided to fix them.


* Note

	- This is my opinionated theme, it might not fit you but honestly I don't really care. I don't accept pull requests or issues, this was published just to share the theme and to be able to use it in antigen.
